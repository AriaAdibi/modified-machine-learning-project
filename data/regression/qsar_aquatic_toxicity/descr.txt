Data Set Information:

This dataset was used to develop quantitative regression QSAR models to predict acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish Pimephales promelas (fathead minnow) on a set of 908 chemicals. to predict acute aquatic toxicity towards Daphnia Magna. LC50 data, which is the concentration that causes death in 50% of test D. magna over a test duration of 48 hours, was used as model response. The model comprised 8 molecular descriptors: TPSA(Tot) (Molecular properties), SAacc (Molecular properties), H-050 (Atom-centred fragments), MLOGP (Molecular properties), RDCHI (Connectivity indices), GATS1p (2D autocorrelations), nN (Constitutional indices), C-040 (Atom-centred fragments).
